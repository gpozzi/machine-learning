# 1. Scope

In this repository I will upload the projects submitted for the data scientist course taught by Acámica.

# 2. Course overview

> Data Science is a career designed for those who seek to learn to analyze data efficiently and apply modern tools in their work. Also for those people who are interested in knowing what it is about this area of knowledge, close to Computer Learning (Machine Learning), Deep Neural Networks (Deep Learning) and Artificial Intelligence.

> As a graduate, you will be able to convert data into information, automate processes and advise on decision making. You will have the ability to take data in a "raw" state and
learn from them, either by visualizing them correctly and efficiently, or by training models (Statistical and / or Machine Learning) that learn from them and help you predict. In addition, you will have essential statistical fundamentals and a solid foundation of the Python programming language, oriented to data analysis.

> But the most important thing is that you will be able to generate your own questions and you will have the tools to answer them.

# 3. The data

Throughout the course I worked with two business cases, explained in depth in the following links:

- [**House Price Prediction**](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/acamica-data-scientist/house_price_prediction): *I have recently joined the Data team of a large real estate company. The first task assigned is to help appraisers value properties, as it's a difficult and sometimes subjective process. To do this, I should develop a Machine Learning model that, given certain characteristics of the property, predicts its sale price.*

- [**NLP**](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/acamica-data-scientist/nlp): *The goal of this project is to be able to predict the score that a user would set given a review by using an Amazon dataset that contained reviews about different products.*
