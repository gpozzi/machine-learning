# 2. Syllabus

## Module 1: Introduction to Data Science <img src = "https://static.thenounproject.com/png/2245695-200.png" width = "25">

### Topics:
- Programming (classes and functions)
- Python and libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Introduction to Machine Learning: classification and regression
- Chart types
- Basic models (trees, KNN, linear regression, logistic regression)
- Evaluation metrics
- MAE
- Train / test split

### [Project: First Machine Learning model](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/Project%2001)
I started performing an EDA on a dataset that contains property data in Argentina. After identifying its particularities, I trained a simple Machine Learning model and performed optimization of its hyperparameters to predict the prices of potential new properties from the given attributes. The precision of the model was not satisfactory due to the lack of adequate preprocessing and its simplicity.

## Module 2: Advanced Tools <img src = "https://static.thenounproject.com/png/788416-200.png" width = "25">

### Topics:
- Machine Learning in depth
- Statistical foundations
- Interpretation of models
- Statistics: distributions, Bayes theorem
- Advanced models: assemblies, SVM, Naive Bayes, neural networks
- Parameter optimization
- Interpretation of models
- Feature engineering: One Hot Encoding, LabelEncoding, Scaling, etc.

### [Project: Features Engineering, Advanced Models and Model Interpretation](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/Project%2002)

In this project I applied feature engineering and advanced models to develop in greater depth and improve the performance of the Machine Learning model obtained in Project 1. Although with a more exhaustive preprocessing and the application of more advanced regression models, the performance improved remarkably (reducing the error by approximately half), due to the lack of collected attributes that correlate better with the price, it was not possible to obtain a model whose error can be used outside the experimental scope.

## Module 3: Applications <img src = "https://static.thenounproject.com/png/2985136-200.png" width = "30">
### Topics:
- Machine Learning in depth
- Statistical foundations
- Interpretation of models
-Statistics: distributions, Bayes theorem
- Advanced models: assemblies, SVM, Naive Bayes, neural networks
- Parameter optimization
- Interpretation of models
- Feature engineering: One Hot Encoding, LabelEncoding, Scaling, etc.

### [Project: Current Applications](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/Project%2003)
In this project, I used an Amazon dataset that contained reviews about different products to, through natural language processing, be able to predict the score that a user would give given a review

## Module 4: Capstone project <img src = "https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ios-7-icons/50/finish_flag-512.png" width = "30">
### [Project: Final Degree Report](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/Project%2004)
In this project I deepened and expanded the results of the previous project by rethinking the problem as a binary classification (positive / negative). Additionally, I classified the 3-star reviews through this methodology to see which product categories presented the highest tolerance from users.
