# Motivation
As online marketplaces have been popular during the past decades, the online sellers and merchants ask their purchasers to share their opinions about the products they have bought. Everyday millions of reviews are generated all over the Internet about different products, services and places. This has made the Internet the most important source of getting ideas and opinions about a product or a service.

However, as the number of reviews available for a product grows, it is becoming more difficult for potential consumers to make a good decision on whether to buy the product. Different opinions about the same product on one hand and ambiguous reviews on the other hand makes customers more confused to get the right decision. Here the need for analyzing this contents seems crucial for all e-commerce businesses.

Sentiment classification is a computational study which attempts to address this problem by extracting subjective information from the given texts in natural language, such as opinions and sentiments. Different approaches have been used to tackle this problem from natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics. In recent years, Machine learning methods have got popular in the semantic and review analysis for their simplicity and accuracy.

Amazon is one of the e-commerce giants that people are using every day for online purchases where they can read thousands of reviews written by other customers about their desired products. These reviews provide valuable opinions about a product such as its properties, qualities and recommendations which helps the purchasers to understand almost every detail of a product. This is not only beneficial for consumers but also helps sellers who are manufacturing their own products to understand the consumers and their needs better.

This project is considering the sentiment classification problem for online reviews using a supervised machine learning model to determine the overall semantic of customer reviews by classifying them both by a five-star rating and also by sentiment (positive / negative). The data used in this study has been provided by Amazon.

Dataset has been provided by [Amazon](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews-ml/), it contains 3 files: `dataset_es_dev.json`,`dataset_es_test.json` and `dataset_es_train.json`.

The dataset contains reviews in Spanish collected between November 1, 2015 and November 1, 2019. Each record contains the review text, the review title, the star rating, an anonymized reviewer ID, an anonymized product ID and the coarse-grained product category (e.g. â€˜booksâ€™, â€˜appliancesâ€™, etc.) The corpus is balanced across stars, so each star rating constitutes 20% of the reviews in each language.

There are **200,000**, **5,000** and **5,000** reviews in the training, development and test sets respectively. The maximum number of reviews per reviewer is 20 and the maximum number of reviews per product is 20. All reviews are truncated after 2,000 characters, and all reviews are at least 20 characters long.

The parameters included are:

- `review_id`:  Identifier of the review. (String - categorical)
- `product_id`: Identifier of the product being reviewed. (String - categorical)
- `created_on`: Identifier of the date review was written in. (Timestamp - numerical)
- `reviewer_id`: Identifier of the reviewer. (String - categorical)
- `stars`: Number of stars given in current review. (Int - numerical)
- `review_body`: Text body of the review. (String - categorical)
- `review_title`: Text title of the review. (String - categorical)
- `language`: Identifier of the review language review was written in. (String - categorical)
- `product_category`: Identifier of the product category. (String - categorical)

# Project description
This project was made for [AcÃ¡mica's](https://www.acamica.com/data-science) data science bootcamp and consists of two iterations (click collapsible sections to see details of each):
<details>
<summary>I</summary>

## Iteration one

The first model starts with a comprehensive `EDA` and applying some simple `data cleaning` techniques to end up building a `machine learning regression model` that performs better than a linear regression. Two models have been tried in this project: **decisionTreeRegressor** and **kNeighborsRegressor**

### Index
- Scope
- EDA and data cleaning
- Preprocessing
  - Data wrangling

  - Data vectorization
  - Setting benchmark model
  - Model training and comparing benchmark with the following models:
    - LinearSVC
    - RandomForest
  - Optimization of the best performing one
- Conclusions
- Next steps

### Conclusions

The value of the RMSE obtained (**US$ 138,384**) is also what some apartments cost, so a model with an error of this magnitude is not recommended to use in real world predictions. It presents some opportunities for improvement, which are best described in the [project's notebook](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/house_price_prediction/DSProject01.ipynb).

## Iteration two
In this version, a more thorough preprocessing has been made, performing `data transformation` (imputation, encoding, outliers removal and data scaling) techniques and finally applying more advanced `machine learning regression models` (**XGBRegressor**, **Decision tree optimized with RandomSearchCV**, **XGBRegressor optimized with RandomSearchCV**, **RandomForest regressor**, **RandomForest optimized with RandomSearchCV**, **ADABoost optimized with RandomSearchCV** and **Polynomial regressor**).

### Conclusions
Proposed improvements to the first iteration significantly improved the model's performance. However, as in the previous report, the model's error (**USD 59,113**) is still significant and unacceptable considering that it is half the value of 27% of the apartments for sale. There is more room for model improvement, which is also described in the [project's notebook](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/house_price_prediction/DSProyecto02.ipynb)
